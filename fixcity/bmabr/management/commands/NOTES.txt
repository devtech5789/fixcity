Twitter-specific stuff
=======================

 TODO: batch-notification of success to cut down on posts:
 if success, maintain a queue of recently successful posts,
 and every N minutes:
 - start with a template success message like
 'thanks for rack suggestions, see http://bit.ly/XXX'
 - while chars < 140:
 -   pop a suggestion from the queue
 -   prepend @username to the message
 -   append &id=X to a url like http://fixcity.org/racks/by_id?...
 -   ... this would be a new view that shows all the id'd racks.
 - build a bit.ly version of the URL and insert it in the message
 - tweet the message
 - repeat until we're out of users, or hit our API limit
 ... or something.

Also batch error messages? We might get a bunch if the server
 goes down and cron keeps running this script...

Or maybe we need to keep some state about tweets
 we couldn't process in case we want to retry them
 and notify user if they eventually succeed?


Generalizing beyond FixCity: SERVER
===================================

All you need is:

- a json view at a URL that we can hit to do something.

- it should return a json dict with app-specific info about the result.

- this dict should have an 'errors' key which is a dict of 'fieldname':
  'errormessage' pairs.

- response codes?
